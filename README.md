# api-spotify-currently-playing-python
Sample of my code where I use Spotify API with Python 3 to fetch my currently playing song and make a song history on discord using webhooks. Since there is already one on the application, it is useless but still liked to do this mini app :)

I am not an expert and I know that my code isnt perfect, if someone see this and want to give me advice you know what to do ^^
